# How to play #
The first text of the game greets you and quickly and explains how the rules are a bit different in this version of the game. Here the Jacks are worth 11, Queens are worth 12 and Kings are with 13.

The object of the game is to beat the dealer and win your bet back. You do this by choosing to hit or stand after your first two cards are given. You score and the dealer's score are shown side by side to better display where you stand currently. If you choose to hit and go over 21 you bust and the dealer wins. If the dealer choose to hit and busts over 21 you win. If your score is higher than the dealer and you choose to stand the dealer could potentially hit and either beat or bust you.

If you win and collect your winnings, you are presented with an option to play again with your new prize money. If you select yes, your betting option reflects how much money you currently have. With all that said happy gambling!
